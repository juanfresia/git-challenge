# Just a commit

You've just screwed it up!! You pushed a commit that never should've gone to
master.

Your task is to _erase_ it. Yeah, I know! It is not good to change the history
of a branch, specially if someone already pulled from it.
But you noticed the mistake the second you pushed, so a quick fix should not
bother anyone, right?

Delete the commit, leave the history as if the latest commit never happened.

After you are done, run the `check_challenge` command to check if you passed the challenge.
