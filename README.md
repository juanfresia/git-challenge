# Git challenge

Welcome! This is a collection of git challenges, try them all!

## How to run a challenge

To run the challenges you need to have Docker installed. Use `sudo docker
run --rm -it gitchallenge/challenge-X` to play challenge X. You will be given a
terminal, some instructions under _README.md_, a local repository and a remote
and your task is to figure out how to fix or fulfill the instructions.
