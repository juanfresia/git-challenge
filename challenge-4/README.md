# Reverting the history

You've just screwed it up, again!! You pushed a commit that never should've gone to
master.

Last time you erased a commit from the remote history people started complaining
they got things messed up. You learned from your mistakes, now you are going to
revert the changes without altering the history.

Revert the last commit, that is, push a _new_ commit that undoes its changes.

After you are done, run the `check_challenge` command to check if you passed the challenge.
