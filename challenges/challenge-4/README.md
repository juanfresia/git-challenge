# Someone else changed the history

Oh, not again...
Fortunately, you've *not* screwed it up this time, someone else has done it for you!

While you were working (and committed!) the next set of changes, your co-worker 
(let's just call her Wheatley) pushed a commit that never should've gone to master.
You have this commit in your local history, but Wheatley removed it from the
remote, so things are not that easy to fix... but you have to do it or else
re-do your changes.

You have to somehow _remove_ Wheatley's ghost commit from your history _before_
pushing your changes to the remote.

After you are done, run the `check_challenge` command to check if you passed the challenge.
